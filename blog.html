      <h1>Frequently Asked Question:</h1>
      <h2>Local Storage vs Session Storage:</h2>
      <p>
        localStorage and sessionStorage are almost identical and have the same
        API. The difference is that with sessionStorage, the data is persisted
        only until the window or tab is closed. With localStorage, the data is
        persisted until the user manually clears the browser cache or until your
        web app clears the data. This tutorial features localStorage, but the
        syntax for sessionStorage is the same.
      </p>
      <h2>Global Scope vs Block Scope:</h2>
      <p>
        In a programming environment, the <b>global scope</b> is the scope that
        contains, and is visible in, all other scopes. In client-side
        JavaScript, the global scope is generally the web page inside which all
        the code is being executed. <br />
        <b>Block scope</b> restricts the variable that is declared inside a
        specific block, from access by the outside of the block. The let & const
        keyword facilitates the variables to be block scoped.

      <h2>How JavaScript event loop work?</h2>
      <p>
        The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform
        non-blocking operations. When an asynchronous task is started, the event
        loop will start running. Once the task is completed, the event loop will
        again check for any other tasks that need to be performed
      </p>
      <h2>How we get undefined in JavaScript?</h2>
      <p>
        undefined is a property of the global object. That is, it is a variable
        in global scope. The initial value of undefined is the primitive value
        undefined. In all non-legacy browsers, undefined is a non-configurable,
        non-writable property. (Even when this is not the case, avoid overriding
        it.) A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined.
        A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is
        being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns
        undefined if a value was not returned.
